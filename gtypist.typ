B:                             Lesson Q1

*:_Q_R_L0
T:			Welcome to lesson Q1.
 :
 :In the Q series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard
 :keyboard.  I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
 :By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
 :alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.
 :
 :If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient.  Typing
 :is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice.  Avoid the tendency to
 :look down at your fingers while typing.  This is a very bad habit and is hard
 :to break later.  If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know.  (But, I won't
 :tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)
 :
 :If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
 :time keeping yourself from looking.  Don't be surprised if you find touch
 :typing slower than your old ways.  It may be slower when you first start.
 :But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.
 :
 :If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons
 :fairly quickly.  Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.

*:_Q_R_L1
T:
 :			The HOME Keys.
 :
 :In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
 :fingers are.  The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
 :This key is called the HOME position.
 :
 :Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key.  Now, place your second
 :finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
 :the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).
 :
 :Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
 :Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar.  (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
 :bar with this thumb.)  Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
 :poised just over the keys.  Each finger should be just barely touching its home
 :key.  This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
 :cidentally press the key down.
 :
 :Above the D-key is the E-key.  Above the K-key is the I-key.  Learn these
 :positions well.  Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your fingers and
 :make sure they are in the HOME position.  Then don't look at them again.

*:_Q_R_L2
T:
 :			DRILL PATTERNS
 :
 :For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
 :screen and instructions at the top of the screen.
 :
 :All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
 :the screen.  If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
 :a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and
 :beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.
 :
 :When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key.  To do this, extend
 :the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key.  Hit the key and
 :zip the finger back to its home position.  Be careful not to let your other
 :fingers move far from their home positions in the process.  Also, be careful
 :not to type an extra space at the end of the line.
 :
 :If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern.  If
 :you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again.  If
 :on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
 :you try again, etc.  Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.

I:(1) Try this:
*:_Q_R_L3
D:asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj

 :Be sure that the F-finger does not linger on the G-key  or the J-finger on the
 :H-key.  Also be sure to use your fingers as follows:
 :
 : 'f' for 't' and 'g', 'j' for 'h', 'u' and 'n', finally use 'l' for 'o' and '.'
 :
 :Note that you always follow a period with two spaces.

 :the first letter of the line until you hit the final carriage return, my
 :stopwatch will be running.  When you finish, I will calculate your typing speed
 :and convert it to words per minute (WPM).  I will also count each of the
 :mistakes you make and display the total number of errors.
 :
 :If you make a mistake, I will beep at you and light up the letter that you
 :should have typed in inverse video (a black letter on a white background).

S:Dear Ted,
 :
 :     A day ago Ann got a bad cut on her arm and a few by her
 :eye and ear.  It is an act of God she did not die.  Her car
 :did the job.  It is the end of her car.  She has no use for a
 :car.  The fee is to be big.  She is in bed, but she can not
 :eat.  She can not eat a bit of egg.  It is no fun at all.
 :
 :     It is hot.  It is too hot for her fur hat, but I can buy
 :a box for it.  I am due any day.  I can cut a day if I fly.
 :It is not far if I go by air.  If I go by car, I add a day.
 :
 :     How is Dan?  Did he get his job?  Dan had to beg for it
 :if he did.  He is big and fat but not bad.  The boy can do
 :it if he can act to fit his age.  Ask him not to act as a kid.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

I:(9) Test Paragraph
*:_R_R_L30
S:     To tell this class all there is to learn is not a real
 :help later.  Let the class plan the loose ease that can hold
 :each hand in place, or plan to end this or that poor slip,
 :or plan to do its total lines in less hours.  As a rule, to
 :plan and to do are also to learn.  The class plans to drop

I:(9) Test Paragraph
*:_R_R_L121
S:     How much do you weigh?  A young boy who is 5 feet tall
 :may weigh 112 pounds; with an extra inch, 115 pounds.  Add 3
 :pounds for any inch added.  Thus if 5 feet and 4 inches, he
 :may weigh 124.  If taller, add 4 pounds for each added inch.
 :If 5 feet and 7 inches, he may weigh 136; if 5 feet and 9
 :inches, 144; if 5 feet and 10 inches, he may weigh 148.  Now
 :add 5 pounds for each added inch.  Thus to stand 6 feet tall
 :may mean 158 pounds.  It is better to be a little over-weight.

B:                            Lesson T1

*:_T_R_L0
T:			Welcome to lesson T1.
 :
 :In the T series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard
 :keyboard.  I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
 :By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
 :alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.
 :
 :If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient.  Typing
 :is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice.  Avoid the tendency to
 :look down at your fingers while typing.  This is a very bad habit and is hard
 :to break later.  If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know.  (But, I won't
 :tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)
 :
 :If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
 :time keeping yourself from looking.  Don't be surprised if you find touch
 :typing slower than your old ways.  It may be slower when you first start.
 :But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.
 :
 :If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons
 :fairly quickly.  Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.

*:_T_R_L1
T:
 :			The HOME Keys.
 :
 :In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
 :fingers are.  The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
 :This key is called the HOME position.
 :
 :Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key.  Now, place your second
 :finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
 :the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).
 :
 :Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
 :Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar.  (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
 :bar with this thumb.)  Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
 :poised just over the keys.  Each finger should be just barely touching its home
 :key.  This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
 :cidentally press the key down.
 :
 :Learn these positions well.  Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your
 :fingers and make sure they are in the HOME position.  Then don't look at them
 :again.

*:_T_R_L2
T:
 :			DRILL PATTERNS
 :
 :For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
 :screen and instructions at the top of the screen.
 :
 :All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
 :the screen.  If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
 :a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and 
 :beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.
 :
 :When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key.  To do this, extend
 :the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key.  Hit the key and
 :zip the finger back to its home position.  Be careful not to let your other
 :fingers move far from their home positions in the process.  Also, be careful
 :not to type an extra space at the end of the line.
 :
 :If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern.  If
 :you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again.  If
 :on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
 :you try again, etc.  Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.

I:Hit the F-key four times with the first finger of your left hand.

 :In this lesson, we will review the letters that you have already practiced
 :and will add the letters E, G, and H and the period.
 :
 :When you reach for any of these keys, be sure to return your finger to its
 :home position.  For example, to hit the H-key, move the first finger of your
 :right hand (the J-finger) slightly to the left.  Tap the H-key and immediately
 :bring your finger back over the J.

T:			SPEED EXERCISES
 :
 :From now on, I will be mixing speed exercises in with the lessons.  In the
 :drills that you have been doing, I make you keep practicing a line until
 :you get it right.  In a speed exercise, I will only display the text once.
 :
 :What will be different is that I will be timing you.  From the time you type
 :the first letter of the line until you hit the final carriage return, my
 :stopwatch will be running.  When you finish, I will calculate your typing speed
 :and convert it to words per minute (WPM).  I will also count each of the
 :mistakes you make and display the total number of errors.
 :
 :If you make a mistake, I will beep at you and light up the letter that you
 :should have typed in inverse video (a black letter on a white background).
 :Just keep going and try to make as few errors as possible.

I:Try this sentence:
*:_T_R_L77
S:Sarah has liked knitting all her life.

I:Try a little longer sentence.
*:_T_R_L78
S:She looked past her garden to the fields and longed to see the other side.

I:When you type a multi-line paragraph, you will have to hit the RETURN-key at
 :the end of each line.
*:_T_R_L79
S:All the sane people in this area sold their gold
 :right at the start.  The insane ones held their
 :gold and later it paid off.

*:_T_R_L80
S:One fine afternoon the king had an idea.  He
 :sent a letter to all the lords and ladies of
 :his land.  He asked for a great feast.  His

 :			NUMERIC KEYS
 :
 :The terminal has two sets of numeric keys.  One set--directly above the
 :alphabetic keys--conforms to the standard for typewriter keyboards.  The other
 :set--to your right--resembles a calculator keypad.  In this typing series we
 :will be concerned only with the standard numeric keys on the main keyboard.
 :(If you would like to learn to touch type on a numeric keypad, use the N-series
 :lessons instead.)
 :
 :NOTE - not all terminals have the numeric keys in a separate keypad
 :
 :The numeric keys, like all the keys you will be learning from now on, vary
 :somewhat from machine to machine.  The 2 through 0 keys are always in exactly
 :the same place on all typewriter keyboards.  (On keypunch machines and some
 :terminals, however, they are located over the U, I, O, J, K, L, M, comma and
 :period keys.  We will not be concerned with these layouts in this series.)
 :Even if a typewriter or terminal has the standard 2 through 0 keys, it may not
 :have a 1 key.  If it does, the 1 will always be next to the 2.  If it does not,
 :you will have to use the L-key.

I:Let's start by using the 1-key, since we have one.  (Use your A-finger.)

*:_T_R_L168
S:The new nine digit zip codes have upset quite a

 :numbers like 73218-4208.  The worst hit will be

 :poorly designed.  Those unstructured programs

 :In this lesson we will be practicing the shifted numeric keys on the
 :terminal keyboard.  I will only be giving you practice in the keystroke
 :motions.  Very few sentence drills or speed exercises are included, since these
 :keys are used so infrequently.
 :
 :If you are typing something which includes one of these special characters and
 :you cannot remember where a key is, look.  But, always make sure to hit the key
 :with the correct finger.  (If you do use the key often, you will eventually
 :learn where it is without looking.)  Since these keys are used infrequently and
 :are in different places on most other keyboards or are totally missing, speed
 :is not important.

T:				THE END
 :
 :You have now completed the T-series of these lessons.  If you have not already
 :done so, you should now start the N-series or S-series.
 :
 :There are a few keys which we have not studied.  If you decide to touch-type
 :these keys, use the closest finger.  Thus, the ESC, TAB, CAPS LOCK, and SCROLL
 :keys use the A-finger.  And, the keys to the far right (BACKSPACE, DELETE, LINE
 :FEED, RETURN, }, {, etc.) use the ;-finger.  The upper keys (f1, f2, etc.) are
 :not usually touch typed as the reach is too far.  If you can, fine.
 :
 :The CONTROL and REPEAT keys are difficult to touch type, but are treated like
 :the SHIFT keys whenever possible.  For example, to REPEAT an exclamation point,
 :hold the REPEAT key down with your ;-finger and then hit the ! with your A-
 :finger.  Certain command sequences, such as Control/S, are hard to do this way.
 :Many people simply hold the CONTROL-key down with their A-finger and then hit
 :the other key with whatever finger is convenient (usually the F-finger in this
 :case).

I:(6)
*:_U_R_L67
S:Strive for typing accuracy.  Speed without accuracy is of little value.
 :Rhythm is the secret of typing skill.  Don't write one part of a word
 :faster than another.  Slow down so that you can maintain a regular rhythm.
 :
 :Think of the letters before you strike them.  Strike the keys evenly, so
 :that the printing impression does not vary.  At the same time, try to
 :develop your stroking speed and make it a habit to release the keys quickly.
 :To get up speed, type each exercise three or four times.
 :
 :To do your best, it is necessary that you be relaxed.  You may be trying so
 :hard that you are all tied up in knots.  Relax consciously.  If you have a
 :feeling of tenseness and hurry, you are not properly relaxed.

*:_D_R_L0
T:			Welcome to the Dvorak Course
 :
 :This course has been planned for beginners as well as experienced typists.
 :If you are a beginner learning to type on the Dvorak keyboard (the American
 :Simplified Keyboard), you will find this keyboard easier to learn than the
 :QWERTY (Sholes) keyboard.
 :
 :This is because the Dvorak keyboard has been scientifically designed to minimize
 :cumulative finger motion while typing English.  The ten letters on the home row
 :(A, O, E, U, I, D, H, T, N, and S) make up about 70% of all keystrokes. These
 :ten letters alone can form over 3000 words.  Needless to say, having these keys
 :in the home row facilitates both speed and accuracy.
 :
 :If you are already an experienced typist on the Sholes keyboard, don't despair:
 :you won't have to unlearn everything you know.  Your basic typing dexterity
 :remains with you, regardless of the keyboard layout.  Learning the Dvorak
 :keyboard is like learning to "play on a new surface", as a tennis player must
 :learn to adjust to grass court or hard court when she has been accustomed to
 :playing on a clay court.

B:                             Lesson C1

T:			Welcome to the Colemak Course
 :
 :This course is intended for beginners as well as experienced typists.  The
 :Colemak keyboard is an alternative to the QWERTY (Sholes) keyboard layout.
 :You will find it easier to learn than the QWERTY and Dvorak keyboard layouts.
 :
 :Like the Dvorak keyboard, this is because the Colemak keyboard layout has been
 :scientifically designed to minimise cumulative finger motion while typing
 :English.  The ten letters on the home row (A, R, S, T, D, H, N, E, I, and O)
 :make up about 70% of all keystrokes.  These ten letters alone can form over
 :3000 words.  Needless to say, having these keys in the home row facilitates
 :both speed and accuracy.
 :
 :Unlike the Dvorak keyboard layout, however, the Colemak keyboard layout has
 :also specifically been designed to be easy to learn for people who are already
 :familiar with using a QWERTY keyboard layout.  Despite this, it appears that
 :the Colemak keyboard is as fast as, if not faster than, the Dvorak keyboard.
 :
 :For information about the Colemak kyboard layout, see <http://colemak.com/>.

T:			General Instructions
 :
 :The fingers of the left hand should be placed over the A-key, the R-key,
 :the S-key, and the T-key.  Similarly, the fingers of the right hand should be
 :placed over the N-key, the E-key, the I-key, and the O-key.  This is called the
 :HOME position.  Only these fingers should be used to press the keys that they
 :are above.
 :
 :In addition to these keys, the SPACE bar should be pressed with the thumb of
 :the right hand.  At the end of every line, the RETURN key should be pressed
 :with the fourth finger of the right hand.

I:(1) Warming-Up Drill

D:If you can do so, will you kindly let us know by return mail.

I:(2) Continuous Copy
*:_M_R_L1
D:My totals were:  $2,309, $5,687, $3,498, $2,408, and $3,697.

I:(3)
*:_M_R_L2
D:A student may type 1 word per minute faster for each added
 :year of age: i.e., 13 to 14, to 15, to 16, to 17, to 18.

I:(4)
*:_M_R_L3
D:Often 25% of first-year students never do 25 words a minute.
 :Many second-year students can type about 45 words a minute.
 :More than 50% do not equal the practical rate of 50 words.

I:(5)
*:_M_R_L4
D:Why do we all thrill over sports?  Maybe it is the tireless
 :skill of the winner that we feel.  Ask the players.  They
 :may agree (Rice,* famous as a sports writer, said the cham-
 :pions all agreed) that skill is only part (50%) of it.

I:(6)
*:_M_R_L5
D:"When you step on the first tee," says the four-time gold
 :champion, Bobby Jones, "you know you can't afford to make
 :one careless slip."  A tired Bobby Jones (this was the way
 :Bobby told it to Rice) has stood on the 16th tee, leading
 :Smith by 18 strokes.

I:(7)
*:_M_R_L6
D:"Up to this point," says Bobby, "I had played 33 holes in 11
 :under par.  I believe it was the best golf I ever played in
 :my life.  But after easing up on the mental side I played
 :the last three holes in 5 over par."

I:(8)
*:_M_R_L7
D:In 1919 Babe Ruth shot into the records with 29 home runs.
 :Yet few know that the Babe worked five years in big games
 :before this start that led past Home Run #600.  You may
 :have cheered Jimmy Foxx and many another.  Yet you can still
 :picture the Babe after two strikes, smashing to the very
 :spot he had "called" a famous home run.

I:(9)
*:_M_R_L8
D:It is the effort against odds that thrills.  We feel these
 :drives that never let down.  We feel (this was the way Rice
 :put it) the champion forces himself into the winning frame of
 :mind.  Can the fast typist afford to do less?  A typist has
 :to face such days of "mental torture" too.  Some days he has
 :to force himself along.  He need not punish his machine.  He
 :must pull himself together (100%) to type his steady, smooth
 :way over all upsets.

I:(9A) Pointed Paragraph (m b)
*:_M_R_L9
S:     Men are bound to believe that business is bad in winter
 :months.  Maybe Mr. Smith remembers that most building became
 :better in September but both November and December seemed to
 :be much behind.  Monday morning my mail box became blocked
 :by urgent requests of many families that small-sized homes
 :be built.  Some jobs may begin to come now from the Chamber
 :of Commerce members.

I:(10) Rhythmic Review
*:_M_R_L10
D:I said, "Never promise to take much money to such places."

S:Dear Dan,
 :
 :     Yes, I came out of the corn, back to the city, both to
 :draw and to do copy on the new cars.  To date I am able to
 :put cash in the bank and bear a bill or two.  The new deed
 :has done it.
 :
 :     The city has been busy but cold for two days.  Dear baby
 :has been to see her best aunt.  A band came by the door.
 :Baby let the bird cage drop down with a blow.  The bird died.
 :Boys put its dead body deep in a dark card case.  Baby also
 :has a ball and blue book to drop.  I put the boat away.  Its
 :deck did burn, but I care not as it does not cost a cent.

S:Dear Bea,
 :
 :     I am glad you feel so for the farm in the East.  Even
 :as a girl of four or five I was ever so glad to find the
 :farm.  In my eyes it was all as good as gold.  Even my feet
 :felt good.  A girl can gain and grow fast on farm food and
 :the fine free air.  Why else did face and form grow full
 :and fair so fast?
 :
 :     On each foot of my farm I felt free from fear.  It
 :gave me my fill of fun.  I felt no fear of any fire in the
 :fall.  Now the fire is a fact and my farm is gone.  Give me
 :my full life, etc.  The game goes on.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:Dear Hal,
 :
 :     Just a line to say I am lost if I cannot fly.  I
 :have to keep on here.  I knew it was but a hope last May.
 :It was just my last idea in June.  Yet I held my head high
 :and did not lose hope.
 :
 :     Why not fly up in the air a half hour or less and
 :look at my lake and our home on the hill?  I left it late
 :last July with one item on my list.  Bill gave me half an
 :hour of help.  Like the lady of the lake I met the king.
 :Bill was a kind king, too.
 :
 :     To lead off into the air and see all our lake so
 :long and lots of land so low, was to live a high hour.  I
 :kept my hand at my ear so as to help hear.  In the air my
 :hair was a loss.  It did not kill me.  I have to fly to know
 :life can be less hard.  I like to hold on and help Bill.  I
 :love to fly.

S:Dear "Pie,"
 :
 :     I open most of my mail and meet the news.  I note that
 :you say Mrs. Page is a mere name but you met the Miss Page.
 :
 :     You must need the car.  Once the pass is open I can move
 :the car over to you.  Do you mind if I make it part of a nice
 :plan to meet Miss Page, too?  Mrs. Page was only a mile past
 :us.  Her son was my age and I made the mile at noon to play a
 :bit.  She paid us for milk.  She did not mean much to me, but
 :her son did.
 :
 :     Next we had more fun up the pass near the poor old No.
 :Nine mine.  I can mark many a mile we once ran.  I must mail

S:Dear Ross,
 :
 :     It is a real rain.  The road is so soft my car can but
 :roll, stop, and roll on.  Are you on the ship?  If I get as
 :far as the ship, can we sail in such a rain?  If we try to
 :sail, the ship is sure to rock or ride on one side.  If I get
 :sick, it is up to you to stay by and show us how to save the
 :ship.  Ann has some sort of song to sing in the rain.  She
 :said she sent it to you.
 :
 :     Did you read of our sale?  We set out a big sign.  Now
 :any sort of suit and any size seem to sell.  We are not rich
 :but we can soon step out or be sold out, if any such rate is
 :to rule.
 :
 :     Ann has not seen the ship as yet.  Rain or no rain, Ann
 :says to send her out.  All the rest of us say the same.  Can
 :you ring me in my room at the shop?
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

I:(5) Pointed Paragraph (i u)
*:_M_R_L20
S:     The public is quite unfair about airing quibbles over
 :house furniture and fruit juices for the university crew.
 :The alumni inquiry into the failure of equipment figures in
 :the issue.  The alumni attitude is useful but continues to
 :put a premium on a victorious crew.  Only genius can guide
 :this outfit uphill and build a suitable crew that won't quit.

I:(6) Pointed Paragraph (d s -)
*:_M_R_L21
S:     Students should be assisted in studying seated at their
 :desks; cross-questioned as to their needs and desires; ad-
 :vised to use up-to-date leads based on studies of standards.
 :By-products of student days, well-bred friends, kindness,
 :self-help, with good grades and degrees, are listed as far-
 :sighted aids.  In Dad's old-fashioned address to his co-
 :workers, he said sadly that ideas are missed less than first-
 :class friends and good-natured wishers.

S:Dear Tris,
 :
 :     It is so very warm at this time of year, I told my wife
 :that you and I wish to go west for a week or two.  Did I
 :tell you what a wind we had?  I went to town to vote for the
 :one man whom I want.  I took a well-used tire.  When it went
 :down on a bad turn, in the woods, I had to walk.  Then the
 :wind more than set in, and I had to wait by a wall.  It got
 :our old tree.
 :
 :     I saw two men and set them to work on the car, till
 :they told me it was no use.  If I were to turn it in, is it
 :true that you can take your car?  I want a wide view and I
 :want to talk with you.  Thus I wait upon your word.  Wire
 :yes if you will take this trip.

S:Dear "Cab,"
 :
 :     Could you apply to the court to allow my claim as agent
 :for Mr. Blank?  I could bring in his books and see about his
 :bills.  If asked, he can cover the costs by checks on a bank
 :that did not break.
 :
 :     Will you allow your child to come alone to see me?  He
 :can have every apple he can carry.  By the way, being clean
 :and above board, you must be above bad cases, but you began
 :to bring in off-color cases after April.
 :
 :     I agree you do not cross the law, but why let men win
 :in a black cause on any basis?  Why not build up your cases
 :from among men of our own class?  Close the awful cases you
 :now carry along to court, and begin again.
 :
 :Sincerely yours,

I:(5) Pointed Paragraph (r t)
*:_M_R_L26
S:     In our motor party on the return trip an attractive
 :quartet first tried to tell thirty or forty short travel
 :stories.  By turns they transferred to the theater, to art
 :matters, to court trial stories.  In the latter a certain
 :doctor is hurt by a first truck, another truck is struck,
 :and three contractors are thrown to the street.  The girl's
 :strong brother has been hurt.  Further, there are arrests
 :and the sort of extra details that enter into true stories.

S:Dear Fred,
 :
 :     I have dared to ask you for an extra favor on the first.
 :If you are not dated, I am to draft you to drive me by horse
 :or car up the grade to the field house at eight.  I guess you
 :have not heard fully about the great dance to be given by the
 :girls on the floor of the field house.
 :
 :     My hands have put fresh green goods on the walls.  Every
 :girl has a green dress, on its front a funny glass heart that
 :she gives as a favor.  The old folks can drive up early, eat
 :and drink and enjoy it all.  We will delay the dance till the
 :girls enter in a dozen files.  It would crush me to death if
 :an error were found in the plans.  Happy hours on earth are
 :never heavy.  Can you doubt that you are going?
 :
 :Sincerely yours,

S:Dear Madam,
 :
 :     I have your two later notes of March 1.  Maybe it is a
 :large order for you to leave for the north in the month of
 :March.
 :
 :     Our place is miles away, but the real issue is that mu-
 :sic means much to us.  A night of music, even one piece of
 :music, has often meant more to me than my local paper and all
 :the power I have known.  If I can plant a love of music in all
 :parts of this place so that all who hear you sing can learn to
 :love it, it will mean more to me than money.
 :
 :     I never laugh at money, but isn't it plain in these
 :lines that price ought to be the least of all the items?  The
 :point is that our plans for your party are more important.  If
 :you read our other offer in the light of our love for music,
 :we might not seem so far away.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

I:(5) Pointed Paragraph (u y)
*:_M_R_L31
S:     If truly quoted, you and Guy, mere youths, fly a con-
 :tinuous journey of thousands of miles yearly in your study
 :of numerous flying routes.  You say you were south in July
 :in the dry country conspicuous for yucca, but now you are
 :busy buying a quota of various useful items to supply your
 :outfit for the famous Yukon.  Yet I am suspicious when you
 :say this unusual survey is monotonous rather than glorious.
 :You should hurry surely to Vancouver for some delicious
 :yuletide fare.  It seems only yesterday that I was conscious
 :of being young and vigorous enough to fly my buoyant plane.
 :If you lucky boys are victorious over any unusually furious,
 :dangerous, or anxious double duty on this survey, write a
 :quotable account yourself for the Journal.

S:Dear Alice,
 :
 :     I shall start my river story since you have shown you like
 :my style.
 :
 :     The scene is a state in the South.  A sweet girl speaks of
 :the sound and sight of the river.  Seven men without shame raise
 :the stock sales and the boy tries to spend too much at the store.
 :In order to make a quiet and quick slide down the river, the men
 :seize the boat while the others, who are quite ready to serve the
 :girl, sleep.
 :
 :     It seems the girl has sense, for on a sheet of paper she
 :writes that her stock of gold is within reach from a round stone
 :under the small shade tree.  She does not quote the boy, but does
 :refer to the sorry end of his short study, and in her reply to his
 :folks she will state how the gold may still be spent in the right
 :way, which will stamp the story as real.

S:Dear Mrs. White,
 :
 :     I wish to thank you for the words you wrote three weeks ago,

 :
 :     As I watch the wheels of events today, I think you value a
 :thing it has taken me a third of my years to see.  In its total
 :trade the world is one whole, and each part in touch with the
 :other at most times.
 :
 :     The usual farm woman won't see a trade table or understand
 :its terms, for she is tired with her efforts to train and teach
 :her young.  She has tried to throw her value into her home, which
 :to her is worth so much.  War can not be put under until these
 :women see there is but one world, which truly is their world.
 :
 :     Where will you be while the thick wheat is harvested?  If
 :not across the water, would you visit us, using your voice to
 :teach us these things?
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:     Important dinner company in our small apartment was
 :not common, and November ninth mamma was solemn in manner.
 :The moment nine American gentlemen were announced, fun and
 :argument began.  I remember one ancient gentleman, manager
 :of much more income than mine, who was not solemn as imag-
 :ined, but funny and human, even if normal demand, planned
 :movements of modern machines to Canada, long term payments,

 :     I did notice a number of the pretty places I passed in

S:Dear Sylvia,
 :
 :     I wonder if my sister talked to you on Sunday of the
 :thirty things we wanted to do this summer?  We were trying
 :all the spring season at school to secure a supply of sim-
 :ple but strong materials for a camp in the valley.
 :
 :     It struck me as we were taking a walk down the street
 :that we would surely be unable to do as we stated unless you
 :took a sudden notion to help.  It seemed to me on second
 :thought we should give thanks to you for giving tongue to our
 :wishes last winter, for you turned the folks in our favor.
 :
 :     My sister was saying that girls from twenty states had
 :signed our pledge, so we are united.  Though this is off the
 :subject, I saw a pretty yellow and silver dress within a win-
 :dow on Main Street toward our corner.  Would you think it
 :suitable for the writer?
 :
 :Sincerely yours,

S:     I acquired a bequest from a quizzical Quaker.  How
 :to apply it was a quandary.  As a quasi artist, I began in
 :Albuquerque to make a quantity of plaques of chance Indian
 :acquaintances.  My masquerade as an artist of quality in
 :that quaint land of quite Spanish art and adobe was adequate
 :and equally unique.  Squeezed in quiet, antiquated adobe
 :quarters, I began quickly and without qualms to qualify as
 :an artist.  After quarrels and questions over my queer tech-
 :niques, I acquired my quota of opaque plaques.

S:Dear Annabel,
 :
 :     My brother and his college friends in the factory decided to arrange an
 :evening exactly as in the old days.  After calling us, they arrived and we
 :carried out the idea.  We used an old college catalog and each girl had an
 :old college dress.
 :
 :     Further to advance the evening, my brother advised us of an old address
 :near the freight yard where certain college boys brought this or that article
 :and were allowed a few dollars.  As we went in, an old man came a step farther,
 :fell forward and against me.  Brother charged him.  Will you believe this care-
 :ful account I enclose?  Between brother and me lay this old man who did seem
 :dead.  I can't express my feeling.  His head was covered with marks of blows.
 :
 :     Already we were anxious to go.  Yet his safe was open, as if to furnish us
 :the old books with the many expense charges against the college boys.  When I
 :looked to see who of our company were in them, I read one balance after another
 :paid from the old country to My Dearest Son.  You are correct if you guess we
 :now ran, because we did.  What follows?  Today's paper doesn't have a line.

 :to do my general work himself, and may not imagine there is any
 :measure of justice in that.  We married men are obliged to do as
 :ordered.
 :
 :     I am leaving a hundred matters.  He has my opinion on each.
 :Tell him the minutes of the last meeting of the members are on my
 :table.  Tell him I haven't an invoice, but have instead an October
 :bill, for our new machine parts.  He may mention this item to the
 :manager, as he has neither its history nor my letters of inquiry.

 :and we shall be looking for you at our new home.

 :I am writing tonight without waiting to go through various reports on our
 :present program.  If I had thought that you would be willing to give me an
 :extra day, perhaps I would have come myself.
 :
 :     As soon as this letter has reached you, and you have finished reading the
 :several items about which I have written, I hope you can give extra working
 :time to my request for special records. These items will suggest a new plan as
 :I picture it.  I shall add them to this note.
 :
 :     It is my purpose to prepare a fast station-to-station service that should
 :be in running order soon.  I suppose it could be started next month.  Let me
 :ask, also, whether we could receipt each payment, as we receive it, on a
 :regular form similar to those in the package shipped you Tuesday.  I am pleased
 :with your showing.  You have been like a soldier on duty in any and all

 :run far out from the city.  The difference between country and

S:     The JOURNAL learned that the relatives on their arrival in
 :April had already referred the trouble to lawyers.  Their early re-
 :turn surprises me.  As to the children themselves, the older girls
 :are personally agreeable, slender, and certainly full of zest.  They
 :travel yearly and already are familiar with the world.  Their father
 :was a quizzical old man who fairly idolized them.  His will leaves
 :them very nearly a half-million dollars.  Only the earlier, first
 :will is very irregular.  I've already quizzed them about the real
 :hazards of quarrels over legal prizes of similar size.  From their
 :replies I've realized slowly that the girls are all right.  It
 :really amazes me that even persons like ourselves promptly seize
 :upon some hostile relative's version of an earlier will, which
 :should be recognized easily as false.

T:			SPEED PRACTICE SERIES
 :
 :The S series of lessons is designed to help you improve your typing speed
 :and accuracy.  It is assumed that you have already learned how to touch
 :type either from a previous course in touch typing or from the T series of
 :these lessons.
 :
 :You can use this series even if you do not know how to touch type.  But, it is
 :recommended that you at least learn to touch type most of the letters of the
 :alphabet before starting this series.  When you encounter a letter or symbol
 :which you have not learned, you will have to look.  This is a very bad habit to
 :get into and is hard to break.  (You needn't worry if you only need to glance
 :down for unusual keys, like the dollar sign.)

*:_S_R_L1
T:			   RULES OF THE GAME
 :
 :I will display a paragraph on the screen.  You should then type the entire
 :paragraph as quickly and as accurately as possible.   As you type each
 :character, I will immediately check it for accuracy.  If it was right, I won't
 :do anything.  But, if you made a mistake, I will beep and write that letter in
 :inverse video (a black character on a white background).  You can ignore the
 :error and continue going; or, you can backup and correct it with the DELETE
 :or BACKSPACE keys.  (I will still count it as an error though.)
 :
 :I will also be timing you.  From the time you type the first character until
 :you hit the final carriage return, my stop watch will be going.  At the
 :end of the paragraph, I will tell you your rating (in words-per-minute).
 :
 :If you made too many mistakes, try the next paragraph slower.  If you made no
 :mistakes or only one or two, try the next one faster.

I:First, a quick warm-up.

 :density diskettes.

S:Dear Sirs:
 :
 :Thank you for sending the diskettes so promptly.  How-

 :
 :I will return these two boxes as soon as I receive the
 :correct ones.
 :

*:_S_R_L6
S:Dear Mr. Smith:
 :
 :Thank you for informing us that the diskettes which you pur-
 :chased from us are not satisfactory.  We are sorry for the
 :inconvenience you have been caused in this transaction.
 :
 :We shall be glad to replace the diskettes you now have or to
 :allow you to select a different brand.  If you will let us know
 :your wishes we shall be glad to give the matter our immediate
 :attention.
 :
 :We hope you will give us the opportunity to prove to you that
 :this incident is most unusual and that we do strive to render
 :to our customers an efficient and courteous service at all
 :times.

 :In this lesson you will be given several excerpts from the classics.
 :Take your time and type them carefully.

I:A Christmas Carol, Stave One, Marley's Ghost
*:_S_R_L28
S:Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all par-
 :ticular about the knocker on the door, except that it
 :was very large.  It is also a fact, that Scrooge had
 :seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
 :in that place; also that Scrooge has as little of what
 :is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
 :London, even including--which is a bold word--the
 :corporation, aldermen, and livery.  Let it also be
 :borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one
 :thought on Marley, since his last mention of his
 :seven year's dead partner that afternoon.  And then
 :let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened
 :that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
 :saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any inter-
 :mediate process of change--not a knocker, but Mar-
 :ley's face.

I:Gulliver's Travels, Chapter One, A Voyage to Lilliput
*:_S_R_L29
S:When I awaked it was just daylight.  I attempted to rise, but I
 :found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to
 :the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied to the
 :ground in the same manner.  I likewise felt several slender
 :ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my thighs.  I
 :could only look upward; the sun began to grow hot, and the
 :light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me;
 :but in the posture I lay could see nothing except the sky.  In a
 :little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg,
 :which, advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up
 :to my chin; when bending my eyes downward as much as I could, I
 :perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a
 :bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back.  In the
 :mean time I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I
 :conjectured) following the first.

I:Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.
*:_S_R_L30
S:I lost no time, of course, in telling my mother all that
 :I knew, and perhaps should have told her long before,
 :and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous
 :position.  Some of the man's money--if he had any--was
 :certainly due to us; but it was not likely that our
 :captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by
 :me, Black Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to
 :give up their booty in payment of the dead man's debts.
 :The captain's order to mount at once and ride for Dr.
 :Livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected,
 :which was not to be thought of.  Indeed, it seemed
 :impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the
 :house:  the fall of coals in the kitchen grate, the very
 :ticking of the clock, filled us with alarms.

I:Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.
*:_S_R_L31
S:The neighborhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by
 :approaching footsteps; and what between the dead
 :body of the captain on the parlor floor, and the thought
 :of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand,
 :and ready to return, there were moments when, as the
 :saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror.  Something
 :must speedily be resolved upon; and it occurred to us at
 :last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbor-
 :ing hamlet.  No sooner said than done.  Bareheaded as we
 :were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and
 :the frosty fog.

 :quite hard.  Take your time and type them carefully.

I:Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene II (Capulet's Garden).
*:_S_R_L33
S:But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
 :It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!--
 :Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
 :Who is already sick and pale with grief,
 :That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
 :Be not her maid, since she is envious;
 :Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
 :And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.--
 :It is my lady; O, it is my love!
 :O, that she knew she were!--
 :She speaks, yet she says nothing:  what of that?
 :Her eye discourses, I will answer it.--
 :I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:

*:_S_R_L34
S:Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
 :Having some business, do entreat her eyes
 :To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
 :What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
 :The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
 :As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
 :Would through the airy region stream so bright
 :That birds would sing, and think it were not night.--
 :See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
 :O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
 :That I might touch that cheek!

I:Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene II (The Forum).
*:_S_R_L35
S:Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
 :I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
 :The evil that men do lives after them;
 :The good is oft interred with their bones;
 :So let it be with Caesar:  The noble Brutus
 :Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
 :If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
 :And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
 :Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,--
 :For Brutus is an honourable man;
 :So are they all, all honourable men,--
 :Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
 :He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
 :But Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And Brutus is an honourable man.

*:_S_R_L36
S:He hath brought many captives home to Rome.
 :Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
 :Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
 :When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
 :Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
 :Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And Brutus is an honourable man.
 :You all did see that on the Lupercal
 :I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
 :Which he did thrice refuse:  was this ambition?
 :Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And, sure, he is an honourable man.

*:_S_R_L37
S:I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
 :But here I am to speak what I do know.
 :You all did love him once,--not without cause:
 :What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
 :O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
 :And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
 :My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
 :And I must pause till it come back to me.

I:The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I (A Court of Justice).
*:_S_R_L38
S:The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
 :It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
 :Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
 :It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
 :'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
 :The throned monarch better than his crown;
 :His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
 :The attribute to awe and majesty,
 :Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;

*:_S_R_L39
S:But mercy is above this scepter'd sway,--
 :It is enthroned in the heart of kings,
 :It is an attribute to God himself;
 :And earthly power doth then show likest God's
 :When mercy seasons justice.  Therefore, Jew,
 :Though justice be thy plea consider this--
 :That in the course of justice none of us
 :Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
 :And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
 :The deeds of mercy.  I have spoke thus much
 :To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
 :Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
 :Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

 :			Numeric Keypad Lessons
 :
 :The N series lessons are provided for practice with the numeric keys available
 :on the H89/H19 terminal.  You do not need to know how to touch type on the
 :standard keyboard in order to learn touch typing on a calculator keypad.  So,
 :you can begin this series right away.
 :
 :When entering numeric values, accuracy is usually more important than speed.
 :Take these lessons very slowly.  Speed will come naturally later.
 :
 :As with the standard keypad, you must start in the HOME position.  Place the
 :first three fingers of your right hand over the 4, 5, and 6 keys of the keypad.
 :(Your thumb and fifth finger are not used.)  Your fingers should be poised just
 :over the keys gently brushing them.  Use the thumb or any finger of your left
 :hand for other keys, such as the SPACE bar.
 :
 :After entering each line, hit the ENTER key with the 6-finger (the third finger
 :of your right hand).  Immediately return your finger to the 6 key.  It is very
 :important that you bring the finger back without looking.

I:Use your third finger only.
